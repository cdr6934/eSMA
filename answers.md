### How would you use this algorithm?
 Since we have stock data; I'd use the output and run th through some anomaly detection methods to identify out of the norm events that may trigger a buy/sell scenario.

### How would you improve it?
That depends:
* Create a comprehensive CLI for the program.
* Input any time series data and giving user ability to define their own parameter of choice
* Create unit tests to ensure the data input would identify informal
* Add more data validation
